Description:

Web application for a conference, to enter first open the register.php to either login or register.
Once the login is done a session will be created and you will be redirected to homepage.php where you
can navigate the web page and choose between the different pages we made.

The sessions.php is filled with information from the database we created and each article will have its
details pages where you can ask questions which will be managed and answeared by admins or trackadmins

The rpofile.php allows you to change your email or name and if you are an admin or trackadmin you get access to 
a "private page" where you can add sessions and manage user presences (only if you are an admin)

There is also a form where users can confirm their presence and input their contents, which will all go to the 
database and be displayed to admins in this admin page.
